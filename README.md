# StatisticsWorkshop

This repository has all code I generated in a series of workshops where I taught the basics about statistical analysis in R. It also has some guides I designed with the basic procedures in R (but they're in spanish)

None of the data used is mine.

Data sets Limia caymanensis.txt, Limia dominicensis.txt, Pamphorichthys scalpridens.txt and Pamphorichthys scalpridens 2.txt are from **In love and war: The morphometric and phylogenetic basis of ornamentation, and the evolution of male display behavior, in the livebearer genus Poecilia. Goldberg et al (2018)**

Data set Trafico.csv is from **Global wildlife trade across the tree of life. Scheffers et al (2019)**

Data set Bd_Lombrices_Tulenapa_todo is from **Spatial Patterns of Edaphic Variables and Soil Macroinvertebrates in a Humid Tropical Forest Relict During Two Climatic Periods (Coastal Plain OF Urabá, Colombian Caribbean). Amortegui-Torres (2017)**

Data set arañas.txt is made-up data with teaching purposes.

The other data sets will not be provided because they are not mine nor published.
